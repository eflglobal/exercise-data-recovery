      First Contact:
      
      Hello,
      
      My name is Aderaritcrevic and I work in a microfinance institution in Brazil.
      I found the EFL website on the internet and I got really interested in your tools to identify entrepreneurs with low risk and growth potential.
      Is there any extra information that you can provide us such as: the costs of buying this testing process; how can we apply to become a partner or apply to run a pilot; more details regarding the psychometric test.
      
      Regards,
      Aderaritcrevic Eculupankit
      Assessor de microcr√©dito 
      
      
      Next step: Orsitov sent him the Introductory PPT.
      
      Next he showed intrest and Ottiaj scheduled a Skype call with Aderaritcrevic and also his boss Actrecic Tarfunonpp (Co-Founder and Executive Director).

      Skype Call Summary:
      Ronalinfrd is a NGO that supports micro-entrepreneurs
      They make a first visit at the sight to determine whom to sponsor, then they analyze them on their platform
      First Credits are maximum 500 dollars, the second and third credit are up to 5000 dollars
      They only grant 10 credits per month.
      
      Since we are currently not sure how the regulations for psychometric tests in Brazil are we put them on hold.
      Meanwhile Actrecic and Aderaritcrevic made a contact to Omabsonuy Tanpatewj he is one of the members of the Regional Council of Ethics in Psychology.
      
      Omabsonuy is right now helping us with the legal regulations of psychological tests in Brazil.
