      Alagpht,
       
      I am writing with a brief update as a follow up from our phone call earlier in the week.  We discussed internally the opportunity to collaborate in Jamaica.  We think that there is a compelling opportunity and are impressed by the number of conversations that you have been able to arrange with senior bankers.  
       
      At the same time, our strategy for the upcoming months is to build and strengthen our base in countries where we are currently managing launches of EFL tools.  Our operational success in these countries will allow us to enter new countries with an even stronger database and more operational experience, reducing the effort required to launch with a new bank.  We estimate that in Q4 of this year we can actively explore new countries and in particular Jamaica.  We have marked a time on our calendar to get in touch in October. 
       
      We understand that your preference is to explore this opportunity immediately.  As a young company with a laser-like focus on the success of our small number of partner banks, we hope that you understand our cautious approach to approach to expansion.  This can lengthen the time to launch in new countries but makes the chances of success in Jamaica even higher which we believe can benefit all parties.  
       
      Best,
