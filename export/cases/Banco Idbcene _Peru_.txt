      Uranirfcakep and I have talked about a \u0093BI Strategy\u0094 for a little while (see\n\
      email below, also including Tlalotenalefo who has local contacts), and I think that\n\
      it makes sense to make a go/no go decision about approaching them now.  If\n\
      \u0093go\u0094, we have to decide who we should contact and in what order.  \n\n\

      Go/No Go Decision\n\n\
      ·         The upside is that they are influential in Aparenctoheeet and their own\n\
      SME business is massive.  They would be a well-recognized bank to have in\n\
      our portfolio. "

      On 4/30 jm met with isebionen enenilelinan, cfo of bi.  Isebionen was an ntd grad that went and worked at esexconotfc before launching a bank in peru and joining bi. Much of the meeting was getting to know each other.

      Bothidwiiped asked the question; “a que te dedicas” and I gave him the pitch. He seemed to get it but put it more in the microfinance box, suggesting that we talk to two people, using his name at Reffwikoth- percy asthream and endmoovi.
