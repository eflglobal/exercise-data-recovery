      Nsuteike conference Dubai (Formerly Tefiti Chicago) 
      Attendees:
      Only two vendors (EFL included), rest of the attendees were primarily SME banking heads and/or MDs/CEOs of financial institutions.  All of the heads of banks were speakers. 
      
      Content and Summary: 
      Knowledge share among banks doing SME lending in Africa, Middle East and South Asia. Tremendously powerful information for understanding the pain points for SME lending institutions (information asymmetry was the word of the conference…which was GREAT for EFL).  <100 attendees, so ample amount of time and familiarity to mingle with the attendees.  Speaking slot was literally last on the last day, but all of the attendees had stayed through (again signaling relevance of content) and it enabled EFL to speak to specifics from the talks during the rest of the conference.  
      EFL was connected through ANDE and also meeting Uamumespikla, Exec VP and head of QR, at ATT conference in Johannesburg in 5/2011. Uamumespikla loves us, and agrees that we provided a lot of value to the group.  CEO of Ingasre is Pumpronsutest Turatoncere, a South African national who also likes EFL quite a bit.  
      
      Other good takeaways:
      Will put institution-specific notes in HighRise…got a lot of good stuff from each of the speaking institutions.  As close to a signed agreement from a bank as you can get from BRAC bank, but we’ll see where it goes.  They want to do a site-visit at Standard Bank.
