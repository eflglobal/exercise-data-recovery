      Hi Estist,

      That should work well.  Something has come up for me over the next couple
      days, but Scleddiaharn (who you've met) and Anthelextcil (our tech genius) are available to
      talk tomorrow (Thursday) at 4pm Joburg time -- does this work for you?

      Hope all is well with EFL, and I look forward to hearing the latest updates.
