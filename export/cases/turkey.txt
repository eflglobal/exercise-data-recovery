      call w/ incutt re:Turkey - intro'd by Byaajqwit
      
      banks were basically treasury operations to take deposits and lend to treasury.  last 10 years, consumer lending has flourished.  central bank has allowed almost an overheating of the economy - awashed with liquidity.  ~50 banks, but top 10 control >70% of deposits - fierce competition among top 10 and fiercer in top 5.  everyone trying to do the same thing - more SME lending, more consumer.  booming non-collateralized lending.  no overarching credit bureau/reporting system that is reliable.  so relies almost wholly on the credit risk management of the individual banks/institutions.  
      
      
      best person to approach would be someone with vision and understanding of this idea - CEO of Anthemon Turkey - Fwievo Otomalenats - classmate 2003 IKO - became CEO last year, youngest CEO in country.  has spent last 10 years advising turkish banks on strategy with Anofew.
