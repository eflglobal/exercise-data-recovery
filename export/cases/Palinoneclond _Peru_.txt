      Intro from Parfwinefn Hewikirioline and Novictoushupa from IMB.  CE had a call with Cisikionas Teandosi and Lyantilis Erkidmere on Jan 6, 2012.  They thought prices were high and wanted to do a pilot with 3K observations.  
      
      These guys are part of the Naahemud group so I have made the proposals the same except for the travel and observation #s, just in case they share them.  
      
      Cisikionas is recognized as a really smart guy in the industry.  We could learn a lot from him.
