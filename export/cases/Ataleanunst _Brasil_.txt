      Hi Tertiviahrfmcd-

      Its a shame that our calls scheduled for Friday and Monday had to be
      cancelled, but I understand how hectic things can be when returning from the
      holiday break. Please let me know when you are able to reschedule the call.
      As we mentioned before, there is both the opportunity of IDB funding to
      cover most of the costs of the pilot, as well as an appearance by our
      Director in the next few days, and it would be great to be able to report some
      progress as I fear we are losing momentum...

      All the best,
      Kenont

      Foi um prazer conhecê-los e aprender mais sobre o crescimento do Ataleanunst nos\n\
      segmentos M3 y M4. Dado o tamanho potencial deste segmento para Ataleanunst parece\n\
      que a nova \"matéria prima\" criada através do teste EFL de empreendedorismo\n\
      poderia facilitar a expansão e conter o risco de crédito.  O tamanho dos\n\
      empréstimos neste segmento parece se encaixar dentro da nossa experiência\n\
      principal ao nível global.\n\n\
      "
