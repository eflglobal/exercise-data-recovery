      Mofint,
      
      I recently caught up with Pnovcceakeit Tigwhet who works with Wealescecen Parenahrin at that
      EFL initiative that was spun out of the Harvard Kennedy School. Although
      they are very much focused on South American/African markets, they have
      received overtures from firms in India and in the future might enter. I
      thought it made sense to connect you guys, and will leave it to you to catch
      up for a chat as you can help with a gut-check and provide soem context for
      the idiosyncrasies in India.
      
      Pnovcceakeit, Mofint helps run Gebumti Advisors and is as close to the action in this
      space in India as anyone.
      
      Thanks,
      Rrereten
