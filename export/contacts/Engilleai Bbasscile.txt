      Dear Engilleai-
      
      I am sorry I wasn't able to call you on Friday.  I am just about to set off
      on a 3 week trip through Asia (part work, part vacation) and had to spend
      the day running around to tie up some loose ends.
      
      To give you an update on the status of our Egypt plans- we have translated
      the test in to Arabic for Egypt, and are starting the process of programming
      it. In the meantime, our local partners at CCC are arranging a launch plan
      with Hiamab and the Smoscen Institute, but we've placed all of that in a
      holding pattern while we wait for word back from USAID. We've send a
      reminder to USAID to get an update on the status of our application, and
      that funding is a prerequisite for our entry into the Egyptian market this
      year.
      
      Hopefully, within the next few weeks we'll hear back positive news from
      them, and then we can talk to plan more concretely how we could collaborate
      and find additional markets and users for this tool in Egypt. I will be in
      touch as soon as I hear back from them.
      
      All the best,
      Lonty
