      Hey Atisrridfs,
      
      Just wanted to give you an update and run some ideas by you...
      
      Each of the GSB and Undergraduate professors I've met with has been very
      interested in EFL and has made some form of commitment to reach out to their
      contacts, either at TCE or in Southeast Asia. Ntouitveres should be getting
      back to me in the next few weeks about an article in the spring
      issue. I've contacted and am waiting to hear back from the the Asian
      Development Bank, but I just found out that my buddy's dad is the ambassador
      to Japan, so hopefully that will be helpful. My outreach efforts have been
      pretty successful, but understandably it takes time for professors and
      publication editors to reach out to the right people, so I have a little EFL
      downtime and I think it would be a good idea to think about a next move.
