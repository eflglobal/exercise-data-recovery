# Data Recovery Exercise
The sales department at your company recently switched CRM providers, and you
have been tasked with helping to transfer account data from the old provider
to the new provider.

The old provider sent you export data in the form of several text files
(located in the [export](export) directory).

However, the new provider only supports imports via CSV, so you'll need to
    implement a program to transform the data into the correct format.

## Objectives
Your task is to analyze the files in the `export` directory and write a program
that extracts the data into a set of CSV files.

You may use any language/framework to complete this exercise.

## Hints
- Your company switches CRM providers on a regular basis.
- The new CRM has an extremely flexible import system, so it's up to you to
    structure the CSV files however you think makes the most sense.
- You may need to make assumptions about the meaning/purpose of some of the
    data. As long as you can justify it, we'll play along.
